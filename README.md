**MySQL-50 | Leetcode**

I have started this study plan on leetcode to practise MySql. It has basic to intermediate and hard questions. For solving them I used MySQL for now.

_P.S. I really adore playing around with MySQL Queries. But you could try postgresql or oracle etc. I have only used oracle application express and I had to understand a thing or two but it was also interesting!_
